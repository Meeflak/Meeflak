- Hello! My name is Micheal Eichenlaub, an aspiring game designer excited about all the possibilities. 
- I cannt wait to see where this adventure takes me. 
- Now that I am extremely close to graduation, I will be diving into some personal learning objectives such as combat system implementation and best practices.
  I have lots to learn! But I look forward to every minute of it. 
  
  I will continue to push to this page weekly to grow my library of demonstrated works.
